## Red Circuit Factory
This rather compact factory produces 360 advanced (red) circuits per minute.  
It takes in 720 plastic per minute (<1 yellow belt), 1,800 copper plates per minute (1 red belt) and 720 iron plates per minute (<1 yellow belt).  
  
The ratios of assemblers are optimized to within about 2 extra copper wire assemblers.  
The red belts are kept to a minimum but are unavoidable in such a compact design.
